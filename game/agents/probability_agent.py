"""
Probability-based agent using DataGenetics optimal strategy.

Based on: http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/december32011/

This agent uses probability density to select the optimal cell to attack.
For each turn, it calculates the probability that each cell contains a ship
by enumerating all possible valid placements of remaining unsunk ships.

Expected performance (based on DataGenetics research):
- Median: ~42 shots to win
- Maximum: ~73 shots
- 56% improvement over random baseline
